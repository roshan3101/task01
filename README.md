# Smart Product Recommendation System

## Overview
This sophisticated recommendation system provides personalized product suggestions using advanced machine learning algorithms. Built with Flask and Python, the system leverages multiple recommendation strategies to deliver highly relevant product suggestions based on user preferences and behavior.

## Key Features

### Multiple Recommendation Approaches
- **Hybrid Recommendations**: Combines multiple algorithms with weighted scoring for optimal results
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Identifies similar users based on both interaction patterns and interest tags
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Analyzes product attributes using TF-IDF vectorization
- **Basic Popularity-Based**: Fallback strategy for new users leveraging category preferences

### Interactive User Experience
- **Real-time Updates**: Recommendations refresh instantly when users like products
- **Dynamic Algorithm Selection**: Users can switch between different recommendation approaches
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI that works across all device sizes
- **Visual Category Organization**: Products are organized by category preference

### Analytics and Insights
- **System Metrics Dashboard**: Track total users, products, and interactions
- **Popular Products**: Identify trending products based on user likes
- **User Behavior Analysis**: Understand user preferences and interaction patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask web application with Python 3.9+
- **Recommendation Engine**: Scikit-learn based algorithms with custom weighting
- **Data Storage**: JSON-based interaction tracking with CSV data sources
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with dynamic content rendering

### Algorithm Details

#### Hybrid Recommendation Engine
The system combines three different recommendation approaches with weighted scoring:
- Collaborative Filtering (60% weight): Uses both interaction patterns and interest similarities
- Content-Based Filtering (30% weight): TF-IDF based product similarity
- Basic Recommendations (10% weight): Category and popularity based

#### Collaborative Filtering Enhancements
- User similarity calculation based on both product interactions (70%) and interests (30%)
- Jaccard similarity for interest tag matching
- Weighted product scoring based on the similarity of recommending users

#### Content-Based Filtering
- TF-IDF vectorization of product attributes (categories and tags)
- Pre-computed product similarity matrix
- Aggregated similarity scores based on user's interaction history

### Data Processing
- Text preprocessing with regular expressions for TF-IDF
- Feature extraction from user and product attributes
- Real-time recommendation matrix updates

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Conda or virtual environment

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n recommendation_system python=3.9
conda activate recommendation_system
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

5. Access the application at http://localhost:5000
